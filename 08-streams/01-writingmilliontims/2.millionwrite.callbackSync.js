But memory usage is not mut around 50 MB only
And system memory is also constant.
Looks like kernel buffer is writing very fast to disk
and there is no memory build up
Although thread poll becomes stuck because of a million loop
Seems like ChatGPT gave worng answer.

 
 fs.writeSync() is synchronous and runs in a tight loop with no waiting.

 You're creating 1 million strings ("${index} \n") back-to-back, and writing them one by one.


 A More Accurate Explanation: 
 fs.writeSync is a blocking call. 
 When your code executes fs.writeSync(fd, ...), the entire Node.js main thread (the event loop) stops
 and waits until that single write operation is handed off to the operating system
 and the OS acknowledges it.
  The loop runs, creates a string ('0 \n'), and calls writeSync. The program freezes.
  The data is sent to the OS kernel's file system buffer. The program waits.
  The OS says "OK, I have it." The writeSync call returns.
  The loop continues to the next iteration ('1 \n'), and the process repeats.


  Where is the high memory usage coming from?
  he memory pressure isn't from Node.js queuing up a million write operations.
   It's from the OS kernel's buffer filling up because your loop is feeding it data faster than the physical disk can write it.
   our Node.js process is essentially force-feeding the OS, and the OS is buffering that data in its own memory space.
   The main thread is blocked, but the OS is working hard in the background.

/**
question for this. since wirteSync is blocking and it will not call the next loop till
first finished up then how come memory is building?should only the meory increase and not the ram utilizattion?
  

Answer:

writeSync does not wait for the data to be physically written to the disk platter.
That would be incredibly slow.
Instead, it waits for the Operating System (OS) Kernel to accept the data
and place it into a memory buffer.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

  1 Your Loop (Iteration 1):
    Your Node.js code calls fs.writeSync(fd, "0 \n").
    The Node.js process is now blocked. It stops everything and waits.

  2 The Hand-off to the OS:
    Node.js hands the data "0 \n" to the Operating System Kernel.
    The OS Kernel says, "Got it, thanks!" and immediately copies that data into a special area of RAM
    called the file system cache or buffer cache. This is an extremely fast memory-to-memory copy.

  3 writeSync "Finishes":
    As soon as the OS confirms the data is in its memory buffer (Step 2),
    it sends a "success" signal back to your Node.js process.
    writeSync unblocks, and your Node.js process is free to continue.


  5 Your Loop (Iteration 2):
    Your loop immediately continues to the next iteration.
    It calls fs.writeSync(fd, "1 \n").
    The entire process from Step 1 repeats.


So, How Does Memory Build Up?

The memory build-up happens inside the Operating System's buffer cache,
not inside your Node.js process's direct memory space.

Think of it like this:
  You (Your Node.js Loop): You are a person who can write letters very, very quickly.
  The Mailroom Clerk (The OS Kernel): The clerk in your office building's mailroom. They can take a letter from you very fast.
  The Mailroom's "Outgoing" Bin (The OS Buffer Cache): A large bin where the clerk puts all the letters.
  The Mail Truck (The Physical Disk): The truck that only comes once every few minutes to empty the bin. It's the slowest part of the system.
  Your loop is so fast that you're handing letters to the clerk (writeSync) faster than the mail truck (the disk) can come and empty the bin.
  The clerk (the OS) is fast enough to keep taking your letters and throwing them in the bin.

  The result: The "Outgoing" bin (the OS buffer cache in RAM) fills up with thousands of pending writes.

  Memory vs. RAM Utilization:

  This also answers your second question. When you look at system monitoring tools:

  The memory usage for your specific Node.js process might stay relatively low and stable,
  because it's only ever holding one small string ("${index} \n") at a time.
  However, the total system RAM utilization will spike.
  This is because the OS Kernel is using a large chunk of the machine's physical RAM
  or its file system buffer to hold all the data you're throwing at it, 
  waiting for the slow disk to catch up.

  So, you are correct that your Node process isn't queuing the data. 
  The Operating System is, and it does so in RAM.
