# ECMA script

> While JavaScript is primarily associated with web development, ECMAScript can be implemented in various environments beyond web browsers. For instance, Node.js uses ECMAScript to provide server-side scripting capabilities.
> JavaScript adheres to the rules and guidelines set forth in the ECMAScript standard, while also adding its own browser-specific features and APIs.
> Browser-specific features and APIs, such as the Document Object Model (DOM) and the Web APIs like fetch() for making HTTP requests, are not part of the ECMAScript specification.
> These are additional functionalities provided by the browser environment to interact with web pages and web servers.
> ECMAScript focuses on defining the core syntax and semantics of the language itself, such as variables, control structures, functions, data types, and built-in objects like Array and String.
> It does not dictate how these features should be implemented in a web browser or any other runtime environment.

> In 1993, the first web browser with a user interface called Mosaic was released.
> In 1994, the lead developers of Mosaic founded a company called Netscape and released a more polished browser called Netscape Navigator.
> Web pages could only be static and there was no interactivity after a page was loaded.
> In 1995, Netscape created a new scripting language called JavaScript.
> The name was purely for marketing purposes as Java was the hot new language back then.

## The advent of Microsoft

> In 1995, Microsoft debuted their browser Internet Explorer.
> Microsoft realized that JavaScript, a new scripting language created by Netscape in 1995, fundamentally changed the user experience of the web and wanted the same for Internet Explorer.
> However, there was no standard specification for JavaScript at the time.
> In 1996, Microsoft reverse-engineered Netscape's JavaScript interpreter to create their own scripting language called JScript.
> The difference between JScript and JavaScript caused compatibility problems. Websites wouldn't work well on both browsers.
> As a result, a period began where web developers had to add "Best viewed in Netscape" or "Best viewed in Internet Explorer" badges to their sites.

## Ecma International

> Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International in November 1996.
> Ecma International is an industry association that works on standardizing information and communication systems.
> Netscape wanted a standard specification for JavaScript so that all browser vendors could follow the same rules. This would help ensure that websites worked the same way on different browsers.
> For each new specification Ecma provides a standard specification and a committee
> Ecma International created a standard specification for JavaScript called ECMA-262.
> They also created a committee called Technical Committee 39 (TC39) to work on the ECMA-262 standard.

## ECMAScript

> Ecma however decided to use the term "ECMAScript" to talk about the official language
> The reason for this is because Oracle (who acquired Microsystems) owns the trademark for the term "JavaScript"
> ECMAScript refers to the standard language whereas JavaScript is what we use in practice and builds on top of ECMAScript

## ES versions

> ECMAScript Versions
> 1997 - ECMAScript 1
> 1998 - ECMAScript 2
> 1999 - ECMAScript 3
> ECMAScript 4 never released
> One version every year since 2015

## JavaScript vs ECMAscript

> JavaScript is the implementation of the ECMAScript standard plus additional APIs and features provided by the environment it runs in
> In the case of web browsers, these additional features include the Document Object Model (DOM) API for manipulating HTML documents, the Fetch API for making HTTP requests, the Web Storage API for client-side storage, and many others.
> "JavaScript" in the context of web development, refers to the combination of ECMAScript (the core language specification) and the Web APIs provided by the browser environment.
> When JavaScript is used in other environments, such as Node.js, it may have different additional APIs available (like filesystem manipulation APIs in Node.js) or lack certain browser-specific APIs like the DOM.
> While JavaScript is primarily associated with web development, ECMAScript can be implemented in various environments beyond web browsers. For instance, Node.js uses ECMAScript to provide server-side scripting capabilities.
> JavaScript adheres to the rules and guidelines set forth in the ECMAScript standard, while also adding its own browser-specific features and APIs.
> Browser-specific features and APIs, such as the Document Object Model (DOM) and the Web APIs like fetch() for making HTTP requests, are not part of the ECMAScript specification.

## ECMAScript Summary

> ECMA-262 is the language specification
> ECMAScript is the language that implements ECMA-262
> JavaScript is basically ECMAScript at its core but builds on top of that

Core Formula
   JavaScript = ECMAScript + Environment-specific APIs


Browser JavaScript
    Browser JS = ECMAScript + DOM API + Web APIs
    Where Web APIs include: Fetch API, Web Storage, Canvas, WebRTC, Geolocation, etc

Node.js
    Node.js = ECMAScript + Node Core APIs + npm modules
    Where Node Core APIs include: fs, http, path, crypto, stream, etc.

Deno
    Deno = ECMAScript + Deno Core APIs + Standard Library
    Where Deno includes: secure runtime, TypeScript support, browser-compatible APIs


Electron
    Electron = ECMAScript + Node.js APIs + Chromium Web APIs + Electron-specific APIs
