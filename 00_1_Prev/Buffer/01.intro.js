/**
 * Binary data in computer science refers to data that is represented in a binary (base-2) numeral system.
 * This system uses only two symbols: 0 and 1. Each digit in this system is called a bit.
 * Binary data is the fundamental representation of data in computers and digital systems
 * because it aligns with the binary nature of electronic circuitry, which can be in one of two states: on or off.
 *
 * In computers, binary data is used to represent everything from numbers and text to images and sound. For example:
 * - Numbers are represented using binary digits (bits).
 * - Text is encoded using binary codes like ASCII or Unicode.
 * - Images and sound are digitized into binary formats.
 * Binary data is essential for computer operations, data storage, and data transmission.

/**
 * Binary data can be represented in various ways depending on the context and the type of data being handled. Here are some common methods:
 *
 * - Binary Numbers: Direct representation of numbers using binary digits (bits).
 *   let binaryNumber = 0b1010; // Binary representation of the decimal number 10
 *
 * - Hexadecimal (Base-16): A more compact representation of binary data using 16 symbols (0-9 and A-F).
 *   let hexNumber = 0xA; // Hexadecimal representation of the decimal number 10
 *
 * - Octal (Base-8): Another compact form using 8 symbols (0-7).
 *   let octalNumber = 0o12; // Octal representation of the decimal number 10
 *
 * - Base64 Encoding: A method to encode binary data into ASCII characters, often used in data transmission.
 *   let base64String = Buffer.from('Hello, World!').toString('base64'); // Base64 encoding
 *
 * - Binary Files: Files that store data in binary format, such as images, audio, and executable files.
 *   const fs = require('fs');
 *   let binaryData = fs.readFileSync('path/to/binary/file');
 *
 * - Bit Fields: Using specific bits within a byte or group of bytes to represent different values or flags.
 *   let flags = 0b1010; // Using bits to represent different flags
 *
 * - Buffers: In Node.js, the Buffer class is used to handle binary data.
 *   let buffer = Buffer.from([0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04]); // Creating a buffer with binary data
 *
 * These methods allow binary data to be efficiently stored, manipulated, and transmitted in various applications.

/**
 * Apple M1 has around 16 billion transistors.
 * Each transistor can be in one of two states: on or off.
 * This binary nature of transistors is the foundation of digital computing.
 * Binary data is used to represent everything in computers.

/**
 * Transistors (in Computers):
 * - Transistors are the fundamental building blocks of modern digital circuits. They can be in one of two states: on (1) or off (0).
 * - Used in CPUs, memory chips, and other digital logic circuits.
 *
 * Magnetic Storage (in Hard Drives):
 * - Hard disk drives (HDDs) use magnetic fields to represent binary data. Magnetic domains on the disk surface are magnetized in different directions to represent 0s and 1s.
 *
 * Optical Storage (in CDs, DVDs, and Blu-rays):
 * - Optical discs use pits and lands on the disc surface to represent binary data. A laser reads these variations to interpret the data.
 *
 * Flash Memory (in SSDs, USB Drives):
 * - Flash memory uses floating-gate transistors to store binary data. The presence or absence of an electrical charge represents 0s and 1s.
 *
 * Punched Cards and Tape (Historical):
 * - Early computers used punched cards and punched tape, where holes represented 1s and the absence of holes represented 0s.
 *
 * Radio Waves (in Wireless Communication):
 * - In radio communication, binary data can be represented using different modulation techniques such as Amplitude Modulation (AM), Frequency Modulation (FM), and Phase Modulation (PM).
 * - For example, in Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), different frequencies represent 0s and 1s.
 *
 * Fiber Optics (in Optical Communication):
 * - Fiber optic cables use light pulses to represent binary data. The presence of a light pulse represents a 1, and the absence of a light pulse represents a 0.
 *
 * Quantum Computing (in Qubits):
 * - Quantum computers use qubits, which can represent 0, 1, or both simultaneously due to superposition. This is a more advanced and emerging technology.
